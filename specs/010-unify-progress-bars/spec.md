# Feature Specification: Unified Progress Tracking System

**Feature Branch**: `010-unify-progress-bars`
**Created**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "unify progress bars -- we need to implement a way to unify the way the modules comunicate progress each of them have different constrains but we need to make sure that the CLI interface shows a nice progress bar while for module consumption we provide an async interface to keep track of progress. Of course this same async interface should be used to provide the CLI progress bar functionality to avoid code duplication and to promote composibility. Keep a DRY approach"

   ‚Üí Constraints: Different module types, async interface, DRY principle, composability
3. Unclear aspects identified:
   ‚Üí Granularity of progress updates (per-item, per-batch, percentage-based)
   ‚Üí Handling of nested/hierarchical progress (e.g., batch processing with sub-tasks)
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flows defined for CLI and programmatic usage
5. Generate Functional Requirements

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-02

- Q: When a batch processing job has multiple phases (e.g., PDF extraction followed by image processing), how should progress be displayed? ‚Üí A: Hierarchical display - main bar for overall progress, nested bars for current phase
- Q: When the total item count is unknown at the start (e.g., streaming input where items are discovered dynamically), how should progress be displayed? ‚Üí A: Use both - indeterminate spinner with item count displayed
- Q: When a progress callback function raises an exception during processing, what should happen? ‚Üí A: Log and continue - log the error, continue processing without halting
- Q: When the total item count changes during processing (e.g., discovering more files to process mid-stream), what should the system do? ‚Üí A: Support dynamically - update total count and recalculate percentage in real-time
- Implementation preference: Use alive-progress library for CLI progress bar display

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
When users run CLI commands to process files (PDFs, images, audio, text), they need to see visual feedback about processing progress. When developers integrate these modules into their applications, they need a consistent way to monitor progress programmatically without relying on CLI-specific display logic.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a CLI user runs a command to process multiple files, **When** processing begins, **Then** a progress bar appears showing current item, total items, and percentage completion

2. **Given** a CLI user processes a single large file in streaming mode, **When** chunks are processed, **Then** the progress bar updates to reflect completion percentage

3. **Given** a developer uses a processing module programmatically, **When** they provide a progress handler function, **Then** they receive progress updates with current state, total items, and completion percentage

4. **Given** a developer uses multiple processing modules in sequence, **When** each module reports progress, **Then** progress updates use the same data structure and callback signature across all modules

5. **Given** a CLI user runs a command with verbose mode disabled, **When** processing occurs, **Then** no progress information is displayed but processing completes normally

6. **Given** a processing operation encounters an error mid-stream, **When** the error occurs, **Then** progress tracking stops gracefully without leaving partial progress displays

7. **Given** a batch processing job with multiple phases (e.g., PDF extraction + image processing), **When** processing moves between phases, **Then** progress displays hierarchically with a main bar for overall completion and nested bars showing current phase progress

### Edge Cases

- When total item count is unknown at start (e.g., streaming input), progress displays an indeterminate spinner animation combined with a count-up showing items processed (e.g., "Processed: 42 items")
- When total item count changes mid-processing (discovering additional items), the system updates the total dynamically and recalculates the completion percentage (which may decrease temporarily)
- How does the system handle very fast processing where updates happen faster than display refresh rates?
- When a progress callback raises an exception, the error is logged and processing continues without interruption
- How should progress be displayed for operations that complete in under 1 second?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: All processing modules (pdf_extractor, image_processor, audio_processor, text_summarizer) MUST report progress using a unified mechanism

- **FR-002**: Progress reporting MUST support both callback-based (synchronous) and async-based (asynchronous) consumption patterns

- **FR-003**: Progress updates MUST include at minimum: current item count, total item count, and completion percentage

- **FR-004**: Progress updates MUST be optional - modules MUST function normally when no progress handler is provided

- **FR-005**: CLI interfaces MUST display progress bars that consume the unified progress mechanism without duplicating progress tracking logic

- **FR-006**: Progress bars in CLI MUST be visually consistent across all module commands (same format, same information density)

- **FR-013**: Multi-phase processing operations MUST display hierarchical progress with a main progress indicator for overall completion and nested indicators for the current phase

- **FR-014**: When total item count is unknown, progress MUST display an indeterminate state indicator (spinner/pulse animation) combined with a count of items processed without showing a completion percentage

- **FR-015**: Progress tracking MUST allow the total item count to be updated after initial reporting, recalculating percentage completion dynamically as the total changes

- **FR-007**: Progress reporting MUST not significantly impact processing performance (updates should be throttled if necessary)

- **FR-008**: Progress callbacks that raise exceptions MUST NOT halt processing and MUST log the error before continuing

- **FR-009**: System MUST allow progress updates to include optional status messages (e.g., "Processing file X", "Loading model")

- **FR-010**: Progress tracking MUST support dynamic updates to total item count during processing, automatically recalculating completion percentage when the total changes

- **FR-011**: When processing completes, progress MUST indicate 100% completion before cleanup occurs

- **FR-012**: Progress updates MUST be written to stderr when in CLI mode to keep stdout clean for piping

### Key Entities

- **Progress State**: Represents the current state of a processing operation including items processed, total items, percentage complete, optional status message, and timestamp

- **Progress Consumer**: A handler (callback or async handler) that receives progress updates and processes them according to its needs (display, logging, forwarding to UI, etc.)

- **Progress Source**: A processing module that generates progress updates as work is completed (pdf_extractor, image_processor, etc.)

## Notes for Planning Phase

The specification identifies the need for a unified progress tracking system that serves both CLI and programmatic use cases. Key design goals are:

1. **Consistency**: All modules use the same progress reporting mechanism
2. **Composability**: CLI progress bars built on top of the same async interface used by programmatic consumers
3. **DRY Principle**: No duplication of progress tracking logic between CLI and module internals
4. **Flexibility**: Support both sync callbacks and async patterns
5. **Performance**: Progress updates must not significantly slow down processing

Current state analysis reveals that modules have inconsistent progress implementations:
- `pdf_extractor`: Uses ProgressInfo dataclass with detailed fields (pages, percentage, estimated time)
- `image_processor` and `audio_processor`: Use simple ProgressTracker class with callback(current, total) signature
- `text_summarizer` and `llm_client`: No built-in progress tracking

### Implementation Guidance

- **CLI Progress Display**: Use the `alive-progress` library for rendering progress bars in CLI mode. This library provides rich animation support for both determinate and indeterminate progress states, aligns with the hierarchical display requirements, and offers clean stderr output.
