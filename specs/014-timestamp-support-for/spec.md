# Feature Specification: Timestamp Support for Audio Transcription

**Feature Branch**: `014-timestamp-support-for`
**Created**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Timestamp Support for Audio Transcription

Enhance TranscriptionResult model to include optional word-level or segment-level timestamps from Whisper. Add --timestamps CLI flag to audio_processor that outputs transcriptions with temporal markers (e.g., [00:01:23] Speaker: text here). This enables downstream use cases like video subtitles, podcast chapter markers, and time-indexed search. Output formats should support both markdown (human-readable) and JSON (machine-readable) with timestamp arrays."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06
- Q: When timestamp data is unavailable or incomplete from the transcription engine, how should the system respond? ‚Üí A: Warn user but continue, outputting transcription without timestamps
- Q: What level of timestamp granularity should the system provide? ‚Üí A: Segment-level only (timestamps for sentences/phrases)
- Q: What precision should timestamps use? ‚Üí A: Centiseconds (e.g., 00:01:23.45)

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users need to transcribe audio files with temporal information that marks when each segment was spoken. This enables them to create video subtitles, generate podcast chapter markers, perform time-indexed searches within audio content, and navigate to specific moments in audio recordings. The system provides segment-level timestamps (sentences/phrases) which balance precision with usability for common downstream use cases.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an audio file, **When** user runs audio_processor with --timestamps flag, **Then** system outputs transcription with temporal markers showing when each segment was spoken
2. **Given** a transcription with timestamps, **When** output format is markdown, **Then** timestamps appear in human-readable format with centisecond precision (e.g., [00:01:23.45] text content)
3. **Given** a transcription with timestamps, **When** output format is JSON, **Then** timestamps are provided as structured arrays with start/end times in seconds
4. **Given** an audio file, **When** user runs audio_processor without --timestamps flag, **Then** system outputs transcription without temporal markers (existing behavior unchanged)
5. **Given** a transcription request, **When** --timestamps flag is used, **Then** timestamps are provided at segment-level granularity (sentences/phrases)
6. **Given** multiple audio files processed in batch, **When** --timestamps is enabled, **Then** each file's transcription includes its own timestamp information
7. **Given** a timestamped transcription in JSON format, **When** viewed, **Then** each timestamp entry includes start time, end time, and corresponding text
8. **Given** timestamp data is unavailable from transcription engine, **When** --timestamps flag is used, **Then** system displays warning message and outputs transcription text without timestamp information

### Edge Cases
- When timestamp data is unavailable from the transcription engine, system warns user and outputs transcription without timestamps (non-fatal)
- How does the system handle audio files with very long pauses or silence (timestamps should reflect actual spoken segments)?
- How are timestamps formatted when transcription detects multiple speakers?
- What happens when user requests timestamps in plain/CSV formats that may not naturally support timestamp arrays?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a --timestamps CLI flag for audio_processor that enables timestamp output
- **FR-002**: System MUST capture segment-level timestamps (start and end time for each transcribed segment/phrase)
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide segment-level granularity only (not word-level timestamps)
- **FR-004**: System MUST output timestamps in markdown format as human-readable temporal markers with centisecond precision (e.g., [HH:MM:SS.CC] text)
- **FR-005**: System MUST output timestamps in JSON format as structured arrays with numeric start/end times
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve existing transcription behavior when --timestamps flag is not used
- **FR-007**: System MUST include timestamp information in the transcription result model
- **FR-008**: Timestamps MUST indicate both start and end times for each segment
- **FR-009**: System MUST warn users when timestamp data is unavailable or incomplete but continue processing and output transcription without timestamps
- **FR-010**: Markdown timestamp format MUST be parseable for downstream automation (consistent format required)
- **FR-011**: JSON timestamp arrays MUST include text content associated with each timestamp
- **FR-012**: System MUST support timestamp output for all supported audio formats (mp3, wav, m4a)
- **FR-013**: Batch processing MUST support timestamps for multiple audio files simultaneously
- **FR-014**: Timestamp precision MUST be centiseconds (format: HH:MM:SS.CC where CC is hundredths of a second)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Timestamp Segment**: Represents a time-bounded portion of transcribed audio (sentence/phrase level) with start time, end time, and associated text content
- **Transcription Result**: Enhanced to include optional segment-level timestamp data alongside existing text, confidence scores, and metadata
