# Feature Specification: Real VLM Integration

**Feature Branch**: `003-real-vlm-insegration`
**Created**: 2025-09-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Real VLM Insegration : Complete the implementation of a VLM model to complement the previous 002 task. The model to use should be configurable via env variable and we will use initially for testing "google/gemma-3-4b""

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-28
- Q: What should the default VLM model be when no environment variable is configured? ‚Üí A: Require explicit configuration (no default)
- Q: What should happen when VLM processing exceeds reasonable time limits? ‚Üí A: Use configurable timeout with user-defined behavior
- Q: How should the system handle VLM models that require network downloads during first use? ‚Üí A: Download automatically with progress indication
- Q: What specific environment variable name should be used for VLM model configuration? ‚Üí A: VISION_MODEL
- Q: When should loaded VLM models be automatically cleaned up from memory? ‚Üí A: After batch processing completion

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users need a fully functional Vision Language Model integration that enhances the current implementation with real AI-powered image analysis while preserving the valuable technical metadata currently provided. The system should deliver both AI-generated descriptions and technical image analysis (format, dimensions, file size) as complementary information, with VLM model configuration through environment variables to support different environments.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a supported image file and configured VLM model, **When** user requests image description, **Then** system generates both AI-powered text description and technical metadata (format, dimensions, file size)
2. **Given** JSON output format requested, **When** processing completes, **Then** system returns structured data containing both VLM description and technical analysis metadata
3. **Given** module API usage, **When** called programmatically, **Then** system provides access to both AI description and technical metadata as separate fields
4. **Given** no model is configured via environment variable, **When** system attempts to process an image, **Then** system provides clear error message requiring explicit model configuration
5. **Given** an invalid or unavailable model specified in environment variable, **When** system attempts to load model, **Then** system provides clear error message about model availability
6. **Given** different VLM models configured, **When** processing same image, **Then** system generates descriptions with model-specific characteristics while maintaining consistent metadata format

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the specified VLM model fails to load due to insufficient system resources?
- How does system handle network connectivity issues when automatically downloading model files?
- What occurs when VLM model processing exceeds configurable timeout periods?
- How are model compatibility issues handled when environment specifies unsupported model versions?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST support real VLM model integration enhancing current mock implementation
- **FR-002**: System MUST preserve existing technical metadata analysis (format, dimensions, file size) alongside VLM output
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide both VLM description and technical metadata in JSON output format
- **FR-004**: System MUST expose both AI description and metadata as separate fields when used as module
- **FR-005**: System MUST read VLM model configuration from VISION_MODEL environment variable and require explicit configuration (no default model)
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate model availability and compatibility before attempting to load
- **FR-007**: System MUST load and initialize specified VLM model for image processing
- **FR-008**: System MUST generate actual AI descriptions using loaded VLM model in addition to technical analysis
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain same API interface and response format as existing implementation
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle model loading errors gracefully with specific error messages
- **FR-011**: System MUST optimize model usage to avoid repeated loading for batch operations
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide model information in processing results including model name and version
- **FR-013**: System MUST automatically cleanup loaded models from memory after batch processing completion
- **FR-014**: System MUST validate that environment-specified model exists and is accessible
- **FR-015**: System MUST support configurable timeout settings with user-defined timeout behavior (error, fallback, or continue)
- **FR-016**: System MUST automatically download required VLM models on first use with progress indication and handle network failures gracefully

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **ModelConfiguration**: Environment-based configuration specifying which VLM model to use, including model name, version, and fallback options
- **LoadedModel**: Represents an active VLM model instance in memory, including model metadata, capabilities, and resource usage
- **EnhancedResult**: Combined result containing both real AI-generated description and preserved technical metadata (format, dimensions, file size, processing time)
- **TechnicalMetadata**: Structured technical analysis data including image format, dimensions, file size, and processing statistics
- **ModelRegistry**: System component that validates available models and manages model loading/unloading lifecycle
