# Feature Specification: Prepare Repository for Python Packaging

**Feature Branch**: `012-prepare-this-repository`
**Created**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Prepare this repository for packaging according to: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06

- Q: What Python version compatibility should the packaged project support? → A: >=3.11
- Q: How should this multi-module project be packaged for distribution? → A: Core package + optional extras for each module type (anything-to-ai[module])
- Q: What should be the final package name on PyPI? → A: anything_to_ai
- Q: How should CLI entry points be organized after packaging? → A: Keep separate commands (pdf-extractor, image-processor, etc.)
- Q: Which modules should be included in the initial PyPI release? → A: All 4 modules (pdf, image, audio, text)
- Q: What is the target audience for the PyPI package? → A: Developers (CLI + Python API)
- Q: Should the package include ML model dependencies or require users to install them separately? → A: Users install ML models separately (documentation only)

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → User wants to prepare repository for Python packaging per official tutorial
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: Python packaging, PyPI distribution, build system, metadata
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Define packaging and distribution workflows
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines

- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a Python developer, I want to package this multi-module Python project as a core package with optional extras so that I can distribute it as an installable package on PyPI and other developers can install specific modules like `anything_to_ai[pdf]` or the full suite for both CLI and programmatic use.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the repository has proper packaging configuration, **When** I run the build command, **Then** distribution archives are generated successfully
2. **Given** distribution archives exist, **When** I upload to PyPI, **Then** the package is installable via pip
3. **Given** a user installs the package, **When** they run the CLI commands, **Then** all file processing modules work as expected
4. **Given** the package is installed, **When** users import modules programmatically, **Then** all APIs function correctly

### Edge Cases

- What happens when build dependencies are missing?
- How does system handle incompatible Python versions?
- What occurs when package name conflicts with existing PyPI packages?
- How are module dependencies handled during installation?
- How are ML model installation and configuration documented for users?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide proper pyproject.toml configuration for core package with optional extras for each module
- **FR-002**: System MUST include appropriate metadata for PyPI distribution (name, version, description, authors)
- **FR-003**: System MUST define all module dependencies and optional dependencies correctly, excluding ML model dependencies
- **FR-004**: System MUST include proper license information and files
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide comprehensive README for PyPI package page
- **FR-006**: System MUST support building both source and wheel distributions
- **FR-007**: System MUST ensure all CLI entry points are properly configured
- **FR-008**: System MUST include all necessary package data files in distribution
- **FR-009**: System MUST support installation on Python >=3.11
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate package structure before distribution

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Package Metadata**: Name, version, description, authors, license information
- **Distribution Archives**: Source distribution (.tar.gz) and built distribution (.whl)
- **Entry Points**: CLI commands for pdf_extractor, image_processor, audio_processor, text_summarizer
- **Dependencies**: Required and optional package dependencies with version constraints (excluding ML models)
- **Package Data**: Non-Python files that must be included in distribution
