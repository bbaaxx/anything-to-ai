# Feature Specification: Image VLM Text Description Module

**Feature Branch**: `002-implement-a-module`
**Created**: 2025-09-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Implement a module that will take an image file and will process it with a vlm to create a text description of it using this library. https://github.com/Blaizzy/mlx-vlm, it should follow the same pattern as the pdf extraction feature already in the repo in terms of quality and modularity"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users need to automatically generate text descriptions of image files for content analysis, accessibility, documentation, or podcast script preparation. The process should be as reliable and modular as the existing PDF text extraction, allowing users to process single images or multiple images with consistent, high-quality descriptive text output.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a valid image file (JPG, PNG, etc.), **When** user requests text description, **Then** system generates accurate descriptive text of image contents
2. **Given** a corrupted or invalid image file, **When** user attempts processing, **Then** system provides clear error message about file issues
3. **Given** a large image file, **When** processing starts, **Then** system provides progress updates during VLM processing
4. **Given** multiple images to process, **When** batch processing is initiated, **Then** system processes each image and returns structured results with individual success/failure status

### Edge Cases
- What happens when image file is missing or inaccessible?
- How does system handle unsupported image formats?
- What occurs when VLM processing fails or times out?
- How are very large image files handled for memory management?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept standard image file formats (JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, WEBP)
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate image file existence and format before processing
- **FR-003**: System MUST generate descriptive text content from image using vision language model
- **FR-004**: System MUST return structured results including success status, description text, and processing metadata
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide progress tracking for long-running image processing operations
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle processing errors gracefully with specific error types and messages
- **FR-007**: System MUST support batch processing of multiple image files
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain same modularity patterns as PDF extraction (separate models, processors, exceptions)
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide configuration options for description length and style preferences
- **FR-010**: System MUST expose clean API interface similar to PDF extraction module structure

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **ImageDocument**: Represents an image file being processed, including file path, format, dimensions, and file size metadata
- **DescriptionResult**: Contains generated text description, confidence metrics, processing time, and success status
- **ProcessingResult**: Complete result of image processing operation including all image results, batch metadata, and overall status
- **ProcessingConfig**: Configuration settings for VLM processing including description style, length preferences, and callback options
