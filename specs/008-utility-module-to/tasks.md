## Dependencies

**Setup before everything**:
- T001, T002, T003, T004 must complete before any tests

**Tests before implementation** (TDD):
- T005-T008 (contract tests) MUST complete and FAIL before T009-T040
- Contract tests enforce API contracts throughout development

**Foundation layer**:
- T009-T013 (models, exceptions, config) before everything else
- T013 validates config tests pass

**Infrastructure layer**:
- T014-T018 (cache, retry, unit tests) before T026 (client)

**Adapter layer**:
- T019-T020 (base adapter, factory) before T021-T023 (specific adapters)
- T021-T024 (adapters) before T026 (client)

**Client layer**:
- T026-T029 (client implementation) requires all adapters (T024)
- T030 validates client tests pass

**Integration layer**:
- T031-T035 (integration tests) require T029 (complete client)

**Polish layer**:
- T036-T040 (docs, coverage, linting) after all implementation

**Blocking relationships**:
```
T001-T004 → T005-T008 → T009-T013 → T014-T018
                      ↓
T019-T020 → T021-T024 → T026-T029 → T030
                                   ↓
                          T031-T035 → T036-T040
```

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Example 1: Contract Tests (After T004)
```bash
# Launch T005-T007 in parallel (3 different files)
uv run pytest tests/contract/test_llm_client_api.py -v &
uv run pytest tests/contract/test_adapter_interface.py -v &
uv run pytest tests/contract/test_config_interface.py -v &
wait
```

### Example 2: Data Models (After T008)
```bash
# T009 and T010 work on same file - run sequentially
# T011 works on different file - can run in parallel with T009-T010

# Sequential approach (safer):
# Do T009, then T010, then T011

# Or overlap T011:
# Start T009, T010 sequentially, then T011 in parallel
```

### Example 3: Adapters (After T020)
```bash
# Launch T021-T023 in parallel (3 different adapter files)
# T021: ollama_adapter.py
# T022: lmstudio_adapter.py
# T023: mlx_adapter.py
# All can run simultaneously
```

### Example 4: Integration Tests (After T030)
```bash
# Launch T031-T034 in parallel (4 different test files)
uv run pytest tests/integration/test_ollama_integration.py -v -m integration &
uv run pytest tests/integration/test_lmstudio_integration.py -v -m integration &
uv run pytest tests/integration/test_caching_behavior.py -v -m integration &
uv run pytest tests/integration/test_retry_fallback.py -v -m integration &
wait
```

## File Size Tracking

Monitor these files to ensure <250 lines per constitution:

| File | Estimated Lines | Tasks | Status |
|------|----------------|-------|--------|
| `llm_client/models.py` | ~180 | T009-T010 | ⚠️ Monitor |
| `llm_client/exceptions.py` | ~120 | T011 | ✅ Safe |
| `llm_client/config.py` | ~100 | T012 | ✅ Safe |
| `llm_client/cache.py` | ~100 | T014 | ✅ Safe |
| `llm_client/retry.py` | ~150 | T015 | ✅ Safe |
| `llm_client/adapters/base.py` | ~60 | T019 | ✅ Safe |
| `llm_client/adapters/__init__.py` | ~80 | T020 | ✅ Safe |
| `llm_client/adapters/ollama_adapter.py` | ~200 | T021 | ⚠️ Monitor |
| `llm_client/adapters/lmstudio_adapter.py` | ~200 | T022 | ⚠️ Monitor |
| `llm_client/adapters/mlx_adapter.py` | ~200 | T023 | ⚠️ Monitor |
| `llm_client/client.py` | ~230 | T026-T028 | ⚠️ Monitor |
| `llm_client/__init__.py` | ~100 | T029 | ✅ Safe |

**Action**: If any file approaches 250 lines during implementation, refactor by extracting helper functions to separate module.

- **Parallel Tasks**: 18 tasks marked [P] can run independently
- **Service Dependencies**: Integration tests (T031-T035) require local Ollama/LM Studio running
- **MLX Integration**: T023 maintains backward compatibility with existing image_processor
- **Constitution**: T039 enforces 250-line limit before completion
- **Coverage**: T037 ensures ≥70% test coverage per project standards

---

## Execution Command

To start implementation:
```bash
# After T004 setup complete, run contract tests first
uv run pytest tests/contract/ -v

# Then proceed with implementation tasks T009-T040
# Use parallel execution where marked [P]
```
