## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]

   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-29

- Q: When should automated linting and testing checks run? ‚Üí A: Pre-commit hooks only (block commits with issues)
- Q: Should code formatting be automatic or require manual fixes? ‚Üí A: Hybrid: auto-fix simple issues, manual for complex violations
- Q: What is the minimum acceptable test coverage percentage? ‚Üí A: 70% or higher (moderate coverage requirement)
- Q: What is the maximum acceptable time for pre-commit checks to complete? ‚Üí A: No time limit (completeness over speed)
- Q: Which operating systems must the linting and testing infrastructure support? ‚Üí A: macOS and Linux (most common dev environments)

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a developer contributing to the anyfile-to-ai project, I need automated code quality checks and comprehensive testing to ensure that my changes meet quality standards before they are merged. The system should automatically validate code style, detect common errors, and run tests to verify functionality without requiring manual intervention.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a developer has written new code with simple style violations (whitespace, quotes), **When** they attempt to commit changes, **Then** pre-commit hooks automatically fix these issues and include the fixes in the commit
2. **Given** a developer has written new code with complex violations (high complexity, naming issues), **When** they attempt to commit changes, **Then** pre-commit hooks report the violations and block the commit until manually fixed
3. **Given** a developer has written new code, **When** they attempt to commit changes, **Then** pre-commit hooks automatically run tests and block the commit if tests fail
4. **Given** code quality checks have been configured, **When** a developer runs the test suite manually, **Then** all tests execute and provide clear pass/fail results with coverage information showing at least 70% coverage
5. **Given** code passes all pre-commit checks, **When** the commit is created, **Then** the commit succeeds and changes are saved to version control
6. **Given** a developer needs to commit work-in-progress code, **When** they explicitly bypass pre-commit hooks, **Then** the commit succeeds with a warning that checks were skipped

### Edge Cases

- What happens when linting rules conflict with existing code patterns in the repository?
- How does the system handle tests that are flaky or environment-dependent?
- What happens when new dependencies are added that affect test execution?
- How are test failures communicated to developers who are not familiar with the testing framework?
- What happens when linting configuration changes break previously passing code?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST perform automated code style checking on all Python code files in the repository
- **FR-002**: System MUST execute automated tests covering unit, integration, contract, and performance test categories
- **FR-003**: System MUST prevent commits from being created when linting checks fail
- **FR-004**: System MUST prevent commits from being created when required tests fail
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide clear, actionable feedback when linting or tests fail
- **FR-006**: System MUST run linting and testing automatically via pre-commit hooks that execute before commits are created
- **FR-007**: System MUST ensure consistent test execution across different environments (local development and CI)
- **FR-008**: System MUST measure and report test coverage metrics with a minimum threshold of 70%
- **FR-009**: System MUST lint all changed files without requiring developers to manually specify which files to check
- **FR-010**: System MUST automatically fix simple style issues (whitespace, quotes, import ordering) and require manual fixes for complex violations (logic, structure, naming)
- **FR-011**: System MUST validate code quality metrics such as complexity, duplication, and maintainability using tool-recommended defaults
- **FR-012**: System MUST integrate with the existing test structure (unit, integration, contract, performance)
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide a way to bypass checks for exceptional cases using standard git mechanisms (e.g., --no-verify flag)
- **FR-014**: System SHOULD cache test results to improve execution speed when possible
- **FR-015**: System MUST support running subsets of tests (e.g., only unit tests, only changed modules)

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: Pre-commit checks MUST prioritize completeness over speed, with no time limit imposed
- **NFR-002**: System MUST work on both macOS and Linux operating systems
- **NFR-003**: Linting rules MUST be consistent with project coding standards defined in CLAUDE.md
- **NFR-004**: Test execution MUST be deterministic and produce consistent results across runs
- **NFR-005**: Test coverage MUST not fall below 70% or commits will be blocked

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Linting Configuration**: Defines code style rules, complexity thresholds, and enforcement policies for the project
- **Test Suite**: Collection of automated tests organized by type (unit, integration, contract, performance) with execution metadata
- **CI Pipeline**: Automation workflow that orchestrates linting and testing execution with pass/fail criteria
- **Quality Report**: Output of linting and testing runs including violations, test results, coverage metrics, and actionable recommendations

## Notes

**Current State Analysis**:
The project already has basic linting (ruff) and testing (pytest) tools configured in pyproject.toml. Tests are organized in multiple categories (unit, integration, contract, performance). However, there is no automated enforcement via pre-commit hooks or CI/CD pipelines.

**Clarifications Resolved**:

1. **Trigger Points**: Pre-commit hooks only (block commits with issues) ‚úì
2. **Coverage Requirements**: 70% minimum test coverage ‚úì
3. **Performance Thresholds**: No time limit - completeness over speed ‚úì
4. **Formatting Policy**: Hybrid approach - auto-fix simple issues, manual for complex violations ‚úì
5. **Platform Support**: macOS and Linux ‚úì

**Clarifications Deferred to Planning**: 6. **Quality Metrics**: Specific thresholds for complexity, duplication, and other code quality metrics (implementation detail) 7. **Bypass Mechanism**: Exact scenarios for bypassing checks (operational detail, can use standard git --no-verify) 8. **Test Caching**: Caching strategy (implementation detail, defer to tooling capabilities)
