# Feature Specification: Audio-to-Text Transcription Module

**Feature Branch**: `006-audio-to-text`
**Created**: 2025-09-29
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Audio to text module, We need an audio to text module that follows the patterns of the other existing modules, this one will use a mlx enhanced implementation of whisper, check the readme here: https://github.com/mustafaaljadery/lightning-whisper-mlx/blob/main/README.md. The module should take an audio file and return the text in plain format and json format just like the image processor module, also the module should have a CLI interface as well in the same style as the other two modules"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Extracted: Audio transcription module with MLX-optimized Whisper
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: audio files as input, text output (plain/JSON), CLI interface, module consistency
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Audio format support - which formats? (mp3, wav, flac, m4a, etc.)]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Output language support - English only or multilingual?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Maximum audio file duration limits?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should module support timestamp/segment data like Whisper provides?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Batch processing requirements - multiple audio files at once?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: user provides audio file, receives transcribed text
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement testable via audio input/output verification
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí AudioDocument, TranscriptionResult, TranscriptionConfig
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties" - see clarification markers above
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning after clarifications)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-29
- Q: What audio file formats should the module support? ‚Üí A: Common formats only (mp3, wav, m4a)
- Q: Should the module support multilingual transcription or English-only? ‚Üí A: Multilingual with optional language hint, auto-detect if not provided
- Q: Should timestamp/segment data (showing when each word/phrase was spoken) be included in results? ‚Üí A: Not needed - text only
- Q: What maximum audio file duration should the system support? ‚Üí A: Long form content (‚â§2 hours)
- Q: What transcription quality/speed options should be available to users? ‚Üí A: User can select from available library models: tiny, small, distil-small.en, base, medium, distil-medium.en, large, large-v2, distil-large-v2, large-v3, distil-large-v3
- Q: Should model quantization options be available? ‚Üí A: Yes, users can select quantization from: None, 4bit, 8bit
- Q: Should the system have a default model and quantization setting for users who don't specify preferences? ‚Üí A: Yes, use medium model with 4bit quantization as default (supports auto language detection with balanced performance)
- Q: When an audio file contains no detectable speech (silence/music only), what should the system return? ‚Üí A: Error with "no speech detected" message
- Q: Should the Whisper model's internal batch_size parameter (decoder batching, default 12) be configurable? ‚Üí A: Yes, make it configurable as an advanced option

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A user has audio files (recordings, podcasts, voice notes) that need to be converted to text. The user provides an audio file path to the module and receives accurate transcribed text in their preferred format (plain text or structured JSON). The module should handle common audio file errors gracefully and provide progress feedback for longer recordings.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a valid audio file (supported format), **When** user requests transcription with default settings, **Then** system uses medium model with 4bit quantization and returns transcribed text with confidence metrics and processing metadata
2. **Given** multiple audio files, **When** user requests batch transcription, **Then** system processes all files and returns results for each with success/failure status
3. **Given** a corrupted or unsupported audio file, **When** user attempts transcription, **Then** system returns clear error message identifying the issue without crashing
4. **Given** a very long audio file, **When** transcription is in progress, **Then** system provides progress updates showing percentage completion
5. **Given** user needs JSON output, **When** transcription completes, **Then** system returns structured data including text, confidence scores, and metadata
6. **Given** user needs plain text output, **When** transcription completes, **Then** system returns clean transcribed text without technical metadata

### Edge Cases
- What happens when audio file has no speech content (silence/music only)? System returns error with "no speech detected" message
- How does system handle audio files with extremely poor quality or heavy background noise?
- What happens when audio file is too large to process in available memory?
- How does system handle interrupted processing (timeout, user cancellation)?
- What happens with audio files containing mixed languages within the same recording?
- How does system handle audio files with multiple speakers?
- What happens when audio file exceeds the 2-hour duration limit? System rejects with clear error message

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept audio file paths as input and validate file existence and readability
- **FR-002**: System MUST support common audio formats (mp3, wav, m4a)
- **FR-003**: System MUST transcribe speech content from audio files into text
- **FR-004**: System MUST return transcription results in both plain text and JSON formats

## Notes
- Module must follow architectural patterns established by `image_processor` and `pdf_extractor` modules
- Must use lightning-whisper-mlx library (optimized Whisper implementation for Apple Silicon)
- CLI design should mirror `image_processor/cli.py` structure for consistency
- API surface should match existing module patterns (__init__.py exports, exception hierarchy, config creation)
- Consider memory management for large audio files similar to how image_processor handles large images
