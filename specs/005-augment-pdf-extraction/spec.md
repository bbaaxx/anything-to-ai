# Feature Specification: Enhanced PDF Extraction with Image Description

**Feature Branch**: `005-augment-pdf-extraction`
**Created**: 2025-09-29
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "augment pdf extraction by adding an option to use the image processor to replace any image found on the PDF for a description of what is in the image so the PDF extractor can include this as a part of the detected text, if enabled we will need to have the vision model configured in the environment variable"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-29
- Q: When image extraction or processing fails for individual images within a PDF, what should the system do? ‚Üí A: Include an image placeholder text where the image description would go
- Q: How should image descriptions be formatted and placed in the extracted text output? ‚Üí A: As annotated references (e.g., "[Image 1: description]") inline
- Q: Which image formats within PDFs should be supported for description processing? ‚Üí A: Only web-optimized formats (JPEG, PNG)
- Q: What should happen when processing a PDF with many images would take an excessively long time? ‚Üí A: Allow user to specify processing limits via parameters but default is no limits
- Q: Should there be any data privacy restrictions when processing images with the vision model? ‚Üí A: Allow user to specify privacy mode to skip certain image types but by default no restrictions
- Additional requirement: Clear progress indicators needed for bulk operations with multiple images

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users processing PDFs that contain images want to capture not just the text content but also understand what visual information the images convey. When extracting content from documents, images should be automatically analyzed and their descriptions included in the extracted text output, providing a complete representation of the document's information.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a PDF with embedded images and text, **When** user runs extraction with image processing enabled, **Then** the output includes both original text and AI-generated descriptions of all images
2. **Given** a PDF with only text content, **When** user runs extraction with image processing enabled, **Then** the output contains the text content without any processing overhead
3. **Given** a PDF with images but vision model not configured, **When** user runs extraction with image processing enabled, **Then** system provides clear error message about missing configuration
4. **Given** a PDF with images, **When** user runs extraction with image processing disabled, **Then** the output contains only text content, ignoring images entirely

### Edge Cases
- What happens when images are corrupted or unreadable? ‚Üí Include image placeholder text
- How does system handle PDFs with hundreds of images regarding processing time? ‚Üí User can specify processing limits
- What occurs when vision model service is unavailable during processing? ‚Üí Include image placeholder text
- How are unsupported image formats (GIF, BMP, TIFF) handled? ‚Üí Include image placeholder text

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide an optional flag to enable image description processing during PDF extraction
- **FR-002**: System MUST extract and process all images found within PDF documents when image processing is enabled
- **FR-003**: System MUST generate text descriptions of image content using vision model analysis
- **FR-004**: System MUST integrate image descriptions seamlessly into the extracted text output
- **FR-005**: System MUST require vision model environment configuration when image processing is requested
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide clear error messages when vision model is not properly configured
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing PDF extraction functionality when image processing is disabled
- **FR-008**: System MUST include neutral image placeholder text in output when individual image processing fails
- **FR-009**: System MUST format image descriptions as annotated references (e.g., "[Image 1: description]") placed inline at the image's position in the document
- **FR-010**: System MUST support only web-optimized image formats (JPEG, PNG) for description processing within PDFs
- **FR-011**: System MUST allow users to specify optional processing limits (time or image count) via parameters, defaulting to no limits
- **FR-012**: System MUST allow users to specify optional privacy mode to skip processing of certain image types, defaulting to no restrictions
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide clear progress indicators showing current processing status, especially for bulk operations with multiple images

### Key Entities
- **PDF Document**: Container with text content and embedded images that require processing
- **Image Description**: AI-generated textual representation of visual content extracted from PDF images
- **Vision Model Configuration**: Environment settings that enable image analysis capabilities
- **Extraction Output**: Combined text result containing original document text plus image descriptions
