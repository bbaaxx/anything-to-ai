# Research: PDF Text Extraction Module

## PDF Processing Library Decision

**Decision**: Use pdfplumber as primary dependency
**Rationale**:
- More reliable text extraction than PyPDF2, especially for complex layouts
- Better handling of tables and structured content
- Active maintenance and community support
- Handles both simple and complex PDF structures effectively
- Supports page-by-page processing required for streaming

**Alternatives considered**:
- PyPDF2: Less reliable text extraction, struggles with complex layouts
- pdfminer.six: More complex API, overkill for text extraction needs
- pymupdf: Larger dependency, more features than needed
- Standard library: No PDF processing capabilities

## Progress Tracking Patterns

**Decision**: Callback-based progress tracking with optional percentage reporting
**Rationale**:
- Flexible interface supporting both callback functions and percentage tracking
- Allows different progress reporting strategies (console, API, GUI)
- Low overhead implementation
- Follows Python callback patterns

**Alternatives considered**:
- Event-based system: More complex than needed for this scope
- Polling-based: Less efficient and responsive
- Observer pattern: Overkill for simple progress reporting

## Streaming Architecture

**Decision**: Generator-based page streaming with configurable batch sizes
**Rationale**:
- Memory efficient for large files
- Natural Python iteration patterns
- Easy to implement progress tracking during iteration
- Allows both streaming and batch processing modes

**Alternatives considered**:
- Thread-based streaming: Adds complexity without significant benefit
- Async/await: Not needed for file I/O focused use case
- Chunk-based streaming: Less natural for PDF page structure

## CLI Interface Best Practices

**Decision**: Use argparse with subcommands and rich help text
**Rationale**:
- Standard library solution (minimal dependencies)
- Excellent help generation and error handling
- Supports both simple and complex argument patterns
- Easy to test and maintain

**Alternatives considered**:
- click: External dependency, more features than needed
- fire: Less control over interface design
- Manual parsing: Error-prone and harder to maintain

## Error Handling Strategy

**Decision**: Custom exception hierarchy with specific error types
**Rationale**:
- Clear error messages for different failure modes
- Programmatic error handling for API consumers
- Follows Python exception best practices
- Enables specific handling of PDF-related issues

**Alternatives considered**:
- Generic exceptions: Less informative for debugging
- Error codes: Not Pythonic, harder to handle
- Silent failures: Poor user experience

## Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Pytest with test fixtures for sample PDF files
**Rationale**:
- Industry standard for Python testing
- Excellent fixture system for managing test PDFs
- Good integration with CI/CD systems
- Supports both unit and integration testing patterns

**Alternatives considered**:
- unittest: More verbose, less feature-rich
- doctest: Limited scope for comprehensive testing
- nose: Deprecated and less maintained

## Performance Considerations

**Decision**: Lazy loading with configurable page size thresholds
**Rationale**:
- 20-page threshold aligns with requirement specification
- Balances memory usage with processing efficiency
- Configurable threshold allows tuning for different use cases
- Minimal performance impact for small files

**Alternatives considered**:
- Fixed streaming: Less flexible for different file sizes
- Dynamic threshold: More complex without clear benefits
- No threshold: Could cause memory issues with large files
