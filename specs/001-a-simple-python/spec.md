# Feature Specification: PDF Text Extraction Module

**Feature Branch**: `001-a-simple-python`
**Created**: 2025-09-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "a simple python module that will take a pdf file and read it into text, it should be able to handle small and large files so a way to read by pages and stream the results should be included, also a way to track progress should be available. The module is mainly for internal api consumption but it should be testable from the console by invoking with with \"python -m ... <args>\""

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-28
- Q: What progress tracking format should the module provide? → A: Both callback and percentage via optional parameter
- Q: What command line options should be supported beyond the file path? → A: stream, format, progress
- Q: What should happen when a PDF contains no extractable text (images only)? → A: Raise specific exception with clear message
- Q: What defines "large files" that require streaming versus small files for efficient processing? → A: more than 20 pages
- Q: What output format options should the --format flag support? → A: plain (default) and json only

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I need to extract text content from PDF files of various sizes for further processing. I want to be able to track progress when processing large files and stream results to avoid memory issues. I need both programmatic access for API integration and command-line testing capabilities.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a small PDF file (≤ 20 pages), **When** I process it, **Then** I receive all text content efficiently
2. **Given** a large PDF file (> 20 pages), **When** I process it with streaming, **Then** I receive text page by page with progress tracking
3. **Given** any PDF file, **When** I run from command line with proper arguments, **Then** I can test the functionality interactively
4. **Given** a corrupted or invalid PDF, **When** I attempt to process it, **Then** I receive clear error messages
5. **Given** a password-protected PDF, **When** I attempt to process it, **Then** I receive appropriate error handling

### Edge Cases
- What happens when PDF file doesn't exist or is inaccessible?
- System MUST raise specific exception with clear message when PDF contains no extractable text (images only)
- What happens when PDF is corrupted or truncated?
- How does system handle extremely large files that exceed memory limits?
- What happens when PDF processing is interrupted mid-stream?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST extract text content from valid PDF files
- **FR-002**: System MUST support streaming/page-by-page processing for large files
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide progress tracking during processing
- **FR-004**: Module MUST be importable for programmatic API consumption
- **FR-005**: System MUST be executable via command line using "python -m" syntax
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle small PDF files (≤ 20 pages) and large PDF files (> 20 pages) efficiently
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide clear error messages for invalid inputs
- **FR-008**: System MUST return text content in plain text (default) or JSON format
- **FR-009**: Progress tracking MUST support both callback functions (page number, total pages) and percentage completion via optional parameter
- **FR-010**: Command line interface MUST accept file path as argument and support --stream, --format, and --progress options

### Key Entities
- **PDF Document**: Input file containing text and potentially other content, with page structure
- **Text Content**: Extracted textual data from PDF, organized by page or as continuous stream
- **Progress Information**: Current processing status including pages processed and remaining
- **Processing Session**: Individual extraction operation with associated configuration and state
