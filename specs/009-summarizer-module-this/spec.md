# Feature Specification: Text Summarizer Module

**Feature Branch**: `009-summarizer-module-this`
**Created**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "summarizer module, this module should be able to take a text input (which may be the output of the other modules for example) and process it using the LLM module to generate a summary and tags (at least 3 tags) for the text in json format"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-01
- Q: Should the summarizer enforce a maximum input text length limit? ‚Üí A: No hard limit, but shard analysis if over 10k words
- Q: What should be the target length for generated summaries? ‚Üí A: Smart: LLM decides based on content density
- Q: How should the summarizer handle text in different languages? ‚Üí A: Auto-detect language, always output summary in English
- Q: Should users be able to customize output format beyond JSON? ‚Üí A: JSON and plain text (human-readable)
- Q: What character encoding should the system support? ‚Üí A: UTF-8 only

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user or system component has processed text content (from PDFs, images, audio transcriptions, or other sources) and needs to generate a concise summary along with categorization tags. The user provides the text to the summarizer module, which analyzes the content and returns a structured JSON response containing the summary and relevant tags for organization and retrieval.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a text document containing technical content, **When** the user processes it through the summarizer, **Then** the system returns a JSON object with a concise summary and at least 3 relevant tags
2. **Given** text output from the PDF extractor or image processor modules, **When** the user pipes it into the summarizer, **Then** the system accepts the input and generates appropriate summary and tags
3. **Given** a multi-paragraph article or transcript, **When** the user requests summarization, **Then** the LLM determines appropriate summary length based on content density and complexity
4. **Given** text with multiple topics, **When** the summarizer processes it, **Then** the tags reflect the main themes and categories present in the content

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the input text is empty or contains only whitespace?
- What happens when the input text is extremely short (e.g., single sentence) and already concise?
- What happens when the input text exceeds 10,000 words and requires sharded analysis?
- What happens when the input text is in a non-English language and requires translation?
- What happens when the input text is not valid UTF-8?
- What happens if the LLM module fails or is unavailable?
- How does the system handle malformed or binary input?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept text input from command-line arguments or standard input
- **FR-002**: System MUST integrate with the existing LLM client module to generate summaries
- **FR-003**: System MUST generate a summary where the LLM determines appropriate length based on content density and complexity
- **FR-004**: System MUST generate at least 3 relevant tags that categorize the content
- **FR-005**: System MUST output results in either JSON format (default) or plain text format based on user preference
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle text input from other modules (PDF extractor, image processor, audio processor)
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide clear error messages when input is invalid or processing fails
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate that generated tags meet minimum requirements (at least 3 tags)
- **FR-009**: System MUST use sharded/chunked analysis for text inputs exceeding 10,000 words
- **FR-010**: System MUST auto-detect input language and always generate summaries and tags in English regardless of source language
- **FR-011**: System MUST accept and process text input in UTF-8 encoding only

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Text Input**: The raw text content to be summarized, potentially sourced from other modules or direct user input
- **Summary**: A condensed version of the input text that captures the main points and key information
- **Tags**: A collection of categorization keywords (minimum 3) that represent the main themes, topics, or categories in the text
- **Output Format**: Results provided in either JSON (structured data with defined schema) or plain text (human-readable format with summary and tags)
