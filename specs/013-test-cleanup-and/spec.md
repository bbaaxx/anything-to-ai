# Feature Specification: Test Cleanup and Quality Assurance

**Feature Branch**: `013-test-cleanup-and`
**Created**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Test cleanup and pass, we need the tests and ruff quality check passing"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06
- Q: What minimum test coverage percentage should the codebase maintain to be considered acceptable? ‚Üí A: 80% coverage (industry standard minimum)
- Q: Which quality aspects should be prioritized for the ruff quality checks? ‚Üí A: Code complexity and maintainability metrics
- Q: How should flaky tests (tests that sometimes pass and sometimes fail) be handled? ‚Üí A: Quarantine flaky tests in a separate test suite
- Q: What should happen when quality check rules conflict with existing code patterns? ‚Üí A: Update existing code to match new quality rules
- Q: How should the system handle situations where fixing one issue introduces new test failures or quality violations? ‚Üí A: Require all fixes to be atomic (no new issues introduced)

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the anyfile-to-ai project, I need to ensure all tests pass and code quality checks succeed so that the codebase maintains high standards and new features can be safely integrated.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the codebase has existing tests, **When** I run the test suite, **Then** all tests must pass without failures
2. **Given** the codebase has code quality rules configured, **When** I run the quality check tool, **Then** no quality violations should be reported
3. **Given** there are failing tests or quality issues, **When** I address the identified problems, **Then** the checks should pass on subsequent runs

### Edge Cases
- Flaky tests are quarantined in a separate test suite and excluded from main test results
- Quality check rule conflicts are resolved by updating existing code to match new quality rules
- Fixing issues must be atomic with no new test failures or quality violations introduced

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a way to execute all tests in the codebase
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a way to run code quality checks across all source files
- **FR-003**: System MUST clearly identify which specific tests are failing and why
- **FR-004**: System MUST clearly identify which specific quality rules are violated and where
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure that once all issues are resolved, both test and quality checks pass consistently
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain test coverage at minimum 80% across all modules
- **FR-007**: System MUST enforce quality standards for code complexity and maintainability metrics

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Test Suite**: Collection of automated tests that verify system functionality
- **Quality Check Rules**: Set of coding standards and best practices that source code must adhere to
- **Test Results**: Output indicating pass/fail status of individual tests and the overall suite
- **Quality Report**: Output detailing violations of coding standards and their locations in the codebase
