# Research: Test Cleanup and Quality Assurance

## Test Framework Analysis

**Decision**: Use existing pytest framework with coverage plugin
**Rationale**: Project already uses pytest (see pyproject.toml and pytest.ini), maintains consistency with existing test structure
**Alternatives considered**: unittest (built-in), nose2 (deprecated)

## Quality Check Tool Analysis

**Decision**: Use existing ruff configuration
**Rationale**: Project already configured with ruff (see .pre-commit-config.yaml), provides fast linting and complexity metrics
**Alternatives considered**: flake8 (slower), pylint (more complex configuration)

## Coverage Requirements

**Decision**: Target 80% minimum coverage as clarified
**Rationale**: Industry standard balance between quality and practicality, achievable for existing codebase
**Alternatives considered**: 90% (too high for legacy code), 70% (too low for quality assurance)

## Flaky Test Management

**Decision**: Implement quarantine approach using pytest markers
**Rationale**: Separates unstable tests without losing them, allows focused work on stable test suite
**Alternatives considered**: Deletion (loses test history), retry mechanisms (masks underlying issues)

## Quality Rule Conflicts

**Decision**: Update existing code to match new quality rules
**Rationale**: Ensures consistent codebase, prevents technical debt accumulation
**Alternatives considered**: Legacy exceptions (creates inconsistency), gradual phase-in (delays quality improvements)

## Atomic Fix Validation

**Decision**: Require no new issues introduced by fixes
**Rationale**: Prevents regression whack-a-mole, ensures forward progress on quality
**Alternatives considered**: Temporary regressions (creates instability), documented timelines (hard to enforce)

## Integration Strategy

**Decision**: Use existing pre-commit hooks and CI/CD pipeline
**Rationale**: Leverages existing automation infrastructure, ensures consistent enforcement
**Alternatives considered**: Manual checks (error-prone), separate validation tools (duplicative)
