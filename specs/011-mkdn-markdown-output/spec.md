# Feature Specification: Markdown Output Format Support

**Feature Branch**: `011-mkdn-markdown-output`
**Created**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "mkdn Markdown Output Format Support - Add `--format markdown` option to all modules (pdf_extractor, image_processor, audio_processor, text_summarizer) to output results in structured markdown. For PDFs, preserve headings and structure. For images, create markdown with image references and VLM descriptions as captions. For audio, format transcriptions with speaker labels and timestamps as markdown sections. For summarizer, output summaries with proper heading hierarchy and bullet points. This makes all modules compatible with LLM consumption workflows while remaining human-readable."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a user of the document processing pipeline, I want to output processed results in markdown format so that I can feed them directly into LLM workflows while maintaining human readability. Whether I'm processing PDFs, images, audio files, or text summaries, I need a consistent, structured markdown output that preserves the semantic structure of the source material.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a PDF document with headings and paragraphs, **When** I process it with `--format markdown`, **Then** the output contains proper markdown headings (#, ##, ###) that preserve the document structure

2. **Given** an image file, **When** I process it with `--format markdown`, **Then** the output contains a markdown image reference with the VLM-generated description as the caption

3. **Given** an audio transcription with speaker labels and timestamps, **When** I process it with `--format markdown`, **Then** the output formats each speaker segment as a markdown section with timestamp headers

4. **Given** a text document for summarization, **When** I process it with `--format markdown`, **Then** the output contains the summary with proper heading hierarchy and bullet points for key points

5. **Given** any supported file type, **When** I request markdown output and pipe it to an LLM or save it to a file, **Then** the markdown is syntactically valid and renders correctly in markdown viewers

6. **Given** a batch of mixed file types (PDFs, images, audio), **When** I process them all with `--format markdown`, **Then** all outputs follow a consistent markdown structure convention

### Edge Cases

- When a PDF has no detectable structure (e.g., scanned images without OCR), the system outputs available text as plain paragraphs in markdown format without structure markers
- When images fail VLM processing, the system outputs markdown with generic fallback text (e.g., `![Image](image.jpg)` with "Description unavailable" paragraph)
- When audio files have no detected speaker changes or timestamps, the system outputs transcript as plain paragraphs without speaker headers
- Special markdown characters in transcriptions or descriptions are not escaped; the system relies on markdown processors to handle raw text
- When multiple output formats are specified, the system uses the last specified format (rightmost wins)

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-02

- Q: When a PDF has no detectable structure (e.g., scanned images without OCR), what should the markdown output contain? ‚Üí A: Output as plain text paragraphs (preserve what text exists, no structure markers)
- Q: How should the system handle images that fail VLM processing? ‚Üí A: Output markdown with generic fallback: `![Image](image.jpg)` with "Description unavailable" text
- Q: What markdown format should be used for audio files with no detected speaker changes or timestamps? ‚Üí A: Plain paragraphs with no speaker headers (just transcript text)
- Q: How should special markdown characters in transcriptions or descriptions be escaped? ‚Üí A: No escaping (rely on markdown processors to handle raw text)
- Q: What happens when a user specifies multiple output formats? ‚Üí A: Use last specified format (rightmost wins)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: All processing modules (pdf_extractor, image_processor, audio_processor, text_summarizer) MUST support a markdown output format option

- **FR-002**: PDF processing MUST preserve document structure in markdown format, converting headings, lists, and paragraphs to their markdown equivalents. When structure detection fails, the system MUST output available text as plain paragraphs in markdown format

- **FR-003**: Image processing MUST generate markdown with image references and VLM-generated descriptions formatted as image captions or alt text. When VLM processing fails, the system MUST output markdown with generic fallback alt text and "Description unavailable" message

- **FR-004**: Audio processing MUST format transcriptions as markdown sections with speaker labels and timestamps as markdown headers when available. When speaker detection or timestamps are unavailable, the system MUST output transcript as plain paragraphs

- **FR-005**: Text summarization MUST output summaries with proper markdown heading hierarchy (# for title, ## for sections, - for bullet points)

- **FR-006**: Markdown output MUST be syntactically valid and render correctly in standard markdown viewers and processors

- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to specify markdown format via command-line flag (e.g., `--format markdown`) consistently across all modules. When multiple formats are specified, the system MUST use the last specified format

- **FR-008**: Markdown output MUST remain human-readable while being optimized for LLM consumption

- **FR-009**: The system MUST output content text as-is without escaping markdown special characters, relying on markdown processors to handle raw text appropriately

- **FR-010**: Each module MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing output formats (plain, json, csv) when markdown is not requested

### Key Entities

- **Markdown Document**: A structured text document following markdown syntax conventions, containing headers, paragraphs, lists, code blocks, images, and emphasis. Generated from processing various input file types.

- **Document Structure**: The hierarchical organization of content (headings, sections, subsections, lists, paragraphs) that must be preserved when converting from source formats to markdown.

- **Format Option**: A user-selectable output format (plain, json, csv, markdown) that determines how processed results are structured and presented.
