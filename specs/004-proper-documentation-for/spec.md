# Feature Specification: Comprehensive Documentation for PDF Extractor and Image Processor Modules

**Feature Branch**: `004-proper-documentation-for`
**Created**: 2025-09-29
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "proper documentation for the two already implemented modules PDF extractor and image processor"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Developers and users need comprehensive, accessible documentation to understand and effectively use the PDF extractor and image processor modules. The documentation should serve both as reference material for existing functionality and as onboarding material for new users.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new developer joining the project, **When** they read the documentation, **Then** they can understand module capabilities, installation requirements, and basic usage within 15 minutes
2. **Given** a user wants to extract text from PDFs, **When** they consult the PDF extractor documentation, **Then** they can find clear examples for both CLI and programmatic usage
3. **Given** a user wants to process images with VLM, **When** they read the image processor documentation, **Then** they understand environment setup, model configuration, and usage patterns
4. **Given** a developer encounters an error, **When** they check the documentation, **Then** they can find error codes, troubleshooting steps, and resolution guidance
5. **Given** users want to integrate modules into their applications, **When** they review API documentation, **Then** they can find complete function signatures, parameters, and return types

### Edge Cases
- What happens when users have different technical backgrounds (beginner vs advanced)?
- How does documentation handle version-specific features or changes?
- What if users need examples for uncommon use cases or advanced configurations?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide comprehensive README files for both PDF extractor and image processor modules
- **FR-002**: System MUST include installation instructions with all necessary dependencies and environment setup
- **FR-003**: Documentation MUST contain clear CLI usage examples with common command patterns and options
- **FR-004**: Documentation MUST provide API reference with complete function signatures, parameters, and return types
- **FR-005**: System MUST include code examples demonstrating both basic and advanced usage scenarios
- **FR-006**: Documentation MUST explain error handling with complete error codes and troubleshooting guidance
- **FR-007**: System MUST document configuration options including environment variables and model settings
- **FR-008**: Documentation MUST be structured for easy navigation with clear section headers and cross-references
- **FR-009**: System MUST include performance considerations and best practices for each module
- **FR-010**: Documentation MUST provide integration examples showing how modules work together or with external systems

### Key Entities
- **Documentation Files**: README files, API documentation, usage guides, and troubleshooting guides
- **Code Examples**: Sample scripts, CLI commands, and integration snippets demonstrating module functionality
- **Configuration Guides**: Environment setup instructions, model configuration, and parameter explanations
- **Error Reference**: Comprehensive list of error codes, messages, and resolution steps
